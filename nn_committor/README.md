# Neural Network-Based Solver for the Committor Problem

This project implements a neural network-based solver for computing the committor function in stochastic systems, following the method described in:

> Li, Lin, and Ren, "Computing Committor Functions for the Study of Rare Events Using Deep Learning", arXiv:1906.06285.

## Features

- Langevin dynamics simulation using Euler–Maruyama scheme
- Training with two sampling methods:
  - Artificial temperature (importance sampling)
  - Metadynamics
- Boundary-aware committor function representation using mollifiers
- Transition state sampling constrained to the 0.5-isocommittor surface
- Visualizations of potential, committor, and sampling comparison

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
2. Run the committor script:
    ```bash
    python committor.py
    ```

3. Generated figures (e.g. `potential_and_committor.png`, `transition_states.png`) will be saved in the current directory.

## Files

- `committor.py`: Top-level script for training and visualization
- `README.md`: This file
- `*.png`: Generated output plots
